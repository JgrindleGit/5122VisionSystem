## *Goals for Project*
* Be able to be reused
    * Use reference images
* Detect desired object 
    * Find loaction of object in relation to a certain point on camera
* Ouput data to a Roborio or other desiered processor
* Approximate distance and angle to object 
    * Use reference images to do this
* Merge data and camera stream, output to GUI (if running XServer or ssh allows display over network)

# To Do
